OFFICE HOUR:

ATTENDANCE POLICY: The student is responsible for the material discussed in class,
including material not covered in the text. Missing a class means missing a substantial
portion of the topic lecture and discussion. In the interest of fairness to the students who
attend regularly, the following guidelines to attendance will apply. Class begins promptly as
scheduled. Please be ready to begin at that time. While it is better to arrive late than not at
all, it is better still to arrive on time every time. Students arriving late or leaving early before
the class is dismissed will be counted as absent for the entire class. Excessive absences
and tardiness will affect your grades. An excessive absence for this course is considered

to be more than 10% of the class. Lateness is considered to be after 5 minutes past the start
of class. After your absentee rate has reached 10% of the classes, your grade will be
reduced by 1 letter grade. Missing more than 20% of the classes will result in failure of
the course. If an emergency situation arises, please contact me as soon as possible.
Instructors shall not penalize students for absences for religious observance, military
obligations or jury duty. You should inform the instructor when you anticipate an absence for
any of these reasons so that arrangements can be made for make-up examinations or other
work.

## OFFICIAL WITHDRAWAL FROM A COURSE: 
When a student finds it necessary to withdraw from one or more courses, they must submit an Add/Drop Form with appropriate signatures by the end of the 12th week or its equivalent (see Registration Calendar). A student who officially withdraws from a course between the 4th and 12th weeks or their equivalent will have the course appear on his/her transcript with a grade of W. For more information, visit https://sunyorange.edu/registrar/index.html or email:
registrar@sunyorange.edu

Students are responsible for withdrawing from a class. Any student who does not
officially withdraw from a course will receive an F for that course. A grade of ZF will be
assigned to students who stop attending before the end of the 10th week of the
semester and do not withdraw themselves or receive an instructor withdrawal. Consult
the school schedule for the last day to withdraw from a credit course

## EMAIL FORMAT: 
Email is an essential mode of communication between you and your instructors. It is a
way to ask questions and seek clarifications from your professors outside the classroom. 
To ensure that communication through email is effective and efficient, we ask that you follow the following
guidelines when emailing your professors:
1. The subject line should be clear and include your course and section number. 
2. Use a professional greeting: Begin your email with a formal greeting.
3. If you have multiple questions, number them to make it easier for your professor to respond to them.
4. Use proper grammar and punctuation.
5. Sign off with your full name and A number.

## EXAMS AND QUIZZES: 
Examinations and Quizzes will be given on the dates shown on the attached course outline sheet. The exams will be based on the assigned readings, class lecture material, and handout material. Students will be held responsible for all reading assignments, including assignments not covered in class. The instructor will NOT read textbook assignments in class. 

It is the responsibility of the student to ask questions in class regarding reading assignments he/she did not understand. Refer to the **Grade Distribution** section for the weight of the Tests and Quizzes towards the final grade.

## MAKE-UP EXAMS OR QUIZZES: 
Tests and Quizzes are to be taken at the scheduled time. Only students with an excused absence will be allowed to make up Test and Quizzes. An excused absence would constitute a documented event that could be followed up with a Doctor’s note or prior discussion with the instructor. Failure to make up the test or quiz by the next class meeting will result in an F for that Test or Quiz.  The instructor reserves the right to lower the make-up examination grade by five points. Make up exams for unexcused absences will be at the discretion of the instructor.

## ASSESSMENTS/HOMEWORK: 
There will be assignments/homework. The assignments/homework will be counted as part of the final grade. Assignments/homework received on the due date will receive full credit. Assignments/homework received one week late will receive half credit. Assignments/homework received after that will not receive any credit. All work handed in should contain your name, the date and chapter, project or lab that it covers.

## LABS: 
Labs are due on the date provided by the instructor. Labs not turned in on the due
date will receive a letter grade reduction. Labs received one week late will receive half credit. Labs received after that will not receive any credit.
