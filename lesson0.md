# Tell us about you
- Name
- What Technology Program are you in?
- What you hope to learn?
---
# A bit about me
- I'm a geographer by education, but focused on the technical and statistical side of things. 
- Data is one of my passions. I don't need to be hear, I actually want to be here.
- I've been doing data analytics and engineering professionally for 10+ years.
- I use SQL and Python on a daily basis.
    - If we get through everything we need to cover, hopefully we'll get into merging the two at the end of the semester.

# Expectations: You're Grownups
- Attendance matters, unless there are extenuating circumstances, if I'm here and I expect you here.
- Be respectful of your classmates and I. 
- You're here to learn, so be engaged: ask questions, participate, help eachother! 
- Please don't use your phones in class, I know you were born with them as an appendage, but there is a time and place to use them and it's not here.

# Grading
- If you didn't raise your hand you should have.

# What We'll Cover at 10,000 feet
- Introduction to databases: what they are, how they work and how to build and use them.
- Theory and Practice: I want to make sure that with theory you can understand the practical application. This connection is critical!
- Data Modelling and Database Design: tying together business and technology.
- SQL: what is SQL, how do I use it, why has this language been around for 50+ years?
---
# Hands On
- Once we hit week 3 this class will start to get hands on.
- We'll create enviornments in vSphere and we'll use them throughout the remainder of the semester.
- The goal and hope is that we'll not just be hands on for lab days, but also for our regular lecture days.

# Is there a book for the course?
- Yes and hey look the interwebs has [it](https://archive.org/details/DatabaseSystemDesignImplementationAndManagement12thEditionBYBYCarlosCoronelStevenMorris)!

# What Software will we use?
- vSphere
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) & [Github](https://github.com)
    - Code (or the bones of code) will be here
    - Lectures will be here as pdfs and also written in Markdown (.md) and converted to slides using [MARP](https://marp.app)
- MariaDB 
    - This is a FOSS fork of MySQL (owned by Oracle)
---
# If you do what you're supposed to
- You'll learn and hopefully have fun!
- You'll be prepared for you courses next semester that build off of this!
- If you give it 110% I might even agree to be a reference for a job or college application!
